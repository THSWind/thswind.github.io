It was inspired by the obligate brood parasitism of some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo\" target=\"_blank\">cuckoo</a> species by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds (of other species). Some host birds can engage direct conflict with the intruding cuckoos. For example, if a host bird discovers the eggs are not their own, it will either throw these alien eggs away or simply abandon its nest and build a new nest elsewhere. Some cuckoo species such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World\" target=\"_blank\">New World</a> brood-parasitic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapera\" target=\"_blank\">Tapera</a> have evolved in such a way that female parasitic cuckoos are often very specialized in the mimicry in colors and pattern of the eggs of a few chosen host species.[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_search#cite_note-3\" target=\"_blank\">3]</a>Cuckoo search idealized such breeding behavior, and thus can be applied for various optimization problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pseudo-code\"><em>Pseudo code</em><a title=\"#pseudo-code\" href=\"#pseudo-code\"></a></h3>\n<p>Objective function: (f(x),) x=((x_1,x_2,â€¦,x_d));</p>\n<p>Generate an initial population of (n) host nests;</p>\n<p>While</p>\n","prev":{"title":"MultiProcessing in Python","link":"undefined/MultiProcessing-in-Python"},"next":{"title":"Methods of Selection from Genetic Algorithm","link":"undefined/Methods-of-Selection-from-Genetic-Algorithm"},"plink":"http://thswind.github.io/undefined/Methods-of-Search-from-Genetic-Algorithm/","toc":[{"id":"1-cuckoo-search","title":"1 Cuckoo Search","index":"1","children":[{"id":"pseudo-code","title":"Pseudo code","index":"1.1"}]}],"reading_time":"192 words in 1 min"}
